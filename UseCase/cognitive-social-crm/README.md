# Monitor Twitter feeds to better understand customer sentiment by using Tone Analyzer, and Natural Language Understanding

In this code pattern, our server application subscribes to a Twitter feed as configured by the user. Each tweet received will be analyzed for emotional tone and sentiment. All data is stored in a Cloudant database, with the opportunity to store historical data as well. The resulting analysis is presented in a Web UI as a series of graphs and charts.

When the reader has completed this code pattern, they will understand how to:

- Run an application that monitors a Twitter feed.
- Secure the application using App ID to secure the data.
- Send the tweets to Watson Tone Analyzer and Natural Language Understanding for processing and analysis.
- Store the information in a Cloudant database.
- Present the information in a Angular and nodejs web UI.
- Capture and analyze social media for a specified Twitter handle or hashtag and let Watson analyze the content.

## Flow

![](doc/source/images/architecture.png)

1. User opens the Web App on browser
2. User logs in using Google account.
3. The Web UI calls Node.js application to check if the user is authenticated. And returns the result to Node.js application whether authenticated or not.
4. Once authenticated, tweets are pushed out by Twitter using stream Twitter API. (Steps - Create Twitter Account and twitter application and then tweets are pushed using stream API) .The Node.js app processes the tweet.
5. The Watson Natural Language Understanding Service pulls out keywords and sentiments.
6. The Watson Tone Analyzer Service performs emotional tone analysis on tweets.
7. Tweets and metadata (analyzed data) are stored in Cloudant.
8. The Web UI displays charts and graphs as well as the tweets and the User can view the results on the UI.
9. Logging service (LogDNA) is used to log the Node.js app data and Monitoring service is also used to monitor the health of the app. (Availability Monitoring)

# Steps

The setup is done in 3 primary steps. You will download the code, setup the application (including installing dependencies, Twitter setup, Google Authentication setup and IBM Cloud services setup) and then deploy the code to IBM Cloud or run it locally.

1. [Clone the repo](#1-clone-the-repo)
2. [Install Dependencies](#2-install-dependencies)
3. [Twitter Requirements](#3-twitter-requirements)
4. [Create IBM Cloud services](#4-create-ibm-cloud-services)
5. [Google Authentication Requirements](#5-google-authentication-requirements)
6. [Configure credentials and Twitter listener](#6-configure-credentials-and-twitter-listener)
7. [Run the application](#7-run-the-application)

### 1. Clone the repo

Clone the `cognitive-social-CRM` locally. In a terminal, run:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/IBMRedbooks/Cloud-Application-Developer.git
$ cd Cloud-Application-Developer/UseCase/cognitive-social-crm
```

### 2. Install dependencies

The application requires the following software to be installed locally.

1. [Node (6.9+)](https://nodejs.org): Application runtime environment, download and install the package.
2. [Angular CLI (6.1.1)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/cli): A CLI for Angular applications, installed with: `npm install -g @angular/cli`.

> If you have Angular CLI already installed. Please read the upgrade instructions for Angular CLI when you upgrade the software.

**Using Git Bash**, run the following command, from the application folder, to install both the client and server dependencies.

```
$ npm run install
```

### 3. Twitter requirements

To subscribe to Tweets from a specific handle or hashtag in this application, it is required to create a Twitter account and a Twitter application.
The Twitter account will be used as the account that receives the messages from other Twitter users as well as the owner of the application, required by Twitter, to receive Tweets.

> **NOTE:** In case you did not configure your application with Twitter APIs, there are [sample tweets](server/src/data/SampleTweets.js) that the application will use if no Twitter API is configured so you can test your application.

- You can create a normal Twitter account on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/signup) or use an existing account. It is required to provide a unique email id that isn't already associated with an existing Twitter account as well as a phone number to verify the account.

- Once you have the Twitter account created and verified, log in to [Twitter Dev](https://developer.twitter.com/apps) and create an application.

  > NOTE: The approval process for Twitter applications normally takes 2-3 days.

- Select the Keys and Access Tokens tab and generate a Consumer Key and Secret.
  Keep this page open as you will need to use these tokens into setup procedure in the application later on.

### 4. Create IBM Cloud services

You will create in this section: App ID, Watson Tone Aanalyzer, Watson Natural Language Understanding and IBM Cloudant services on IBM Cloud.

1. Login to [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/)
2. Create IBM Cloud services:

#### App ID:

1. To create App ID instance on IBM Cloud, follow the steps in `Cloud Application Development Course Exercise 4 Part 1`.
2. After the App ID instance is created, Navigate to `Manage Authentication` Tab, disable `Facebook` and `Cloud Directory`.
   > This is because you will be using Google only as an Identity provider.
3. Create service alias for App ID:

   - a. Login to IBM Cloud by running the following command:

     ```
     $ ibmcloud login
     ```

   - b. Select the region, where you have created the App ID instance.
   - c. Target a Cloud Foundry organization and space to select the Cloud Foundry API endpoint, organization, and space by running the following command:

     ```
     $ ibmcloud target --cf-api <CF API ENDPOINT> -o <ORG> -s <SPACE>
     ```

     where <CF API ENDPOINT> is the Endpoint you will connect to , you can find the whole list here: [https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli/reference/ibmcloud?topic=cloud-cli-cf#cf_login], ORG is by default set to your email, SPACE is by default set to `dev`.

   - d. Open the [manifest.yml](manifest.yml) file from the code, copy the App Id alias name; which is: "App ID -s1-alias"
     Run the following command:

     ```
     $ ibmcloud resource service-alias-create "appIDInstanceName-alias" --instance-name "appIDInstanceName" -s {{space}}
     ```

     Replace `appIDInstanceName-alias` with the alias name from manifest.yml, and `appIDInstanceName` with the name of the App ID instance you have created on IBM Cloud, and `space` with the space you logged in.

#### Watson Tone Analyzer

- Create Watson Tone Analyzer: [**Watson Tone Analyzer**](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/tone-analyzer)

#### Watson Natural Language Understanding

- Create Watson Natural Language Understanding: [**Watson Natural Language Understanding**](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/natural-language-understanding)

#### IBM Cloudant

- Create IBM Cloudant: [**IBM Cloudant**](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/cloudant)

> NOTE: When provisioning Cloudant, for `Available authentication methods` choose `Use both legacy credentials and IAM`

![Cloudant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/watson-online-store/master/doc/source/images/cloudantChooseLegacy.png)

### 5. Google Authentication Requirements

To use Google Autheantication for users to login. You will need to configure your App ID instance to use Google as its identity provider.

> NOTE: It is required to have a valid gmail to be able to configure the App ID to use google for authentication. - You can create a gmail account on [Gmail](https://www.gmail.com).

- Go to the [App ID Documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/appid?topic=appid-social#google) and follow the steps to configure App ID to use Google as identity provider.

### 6. Configure credentials and Twitter listener

You configure here the application to use the credentials for IBM Cloud services and Twitter listener.

- [Configure the app to run on IBM Cloud](#configure-to-run-on-ibm-cloud).
- [Configure the app to run locally](#configure-to-run-locally).

### Configure to run on IBM Cloud

In the `manifest.yml` you add the services credentials, configurations and Logging configurations as environment variables to be deployed to IBM Cloud.
After you deploy the application to IBM Cloud, you can find these environment variables added in your application `Runtime` `Environment Variables`.

#### **Configure service credentials**

The credentials for IBM Cloud services (App ID, Tone Analyzer, Natural Language Understanding, and Cloudant), can be found in the `Services` menu in IBM Cloud, by selecting the `Service Credentials` option for each service.

> NOTE: When provisioning Cloudant, for `Available authentication methods` choose `Use both legacy credentials and IAM`

![Cloudant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/watson-online-store/master/doc/source/images/cloudantChooseLegacy.png)

#### **Configure Twitter listener**

You configure the Twitter listener, by adding the consumer key, consumer secret , access token, access secret and the @tag you wish to analyze and to filter the tweets returning based on specific keyword and also if you want to consider the retweets in the results.

You can replace the following variables for that:

```
TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY: <use twitter consumer key>
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET: <use twitter consumer secret>
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN: <use twitter access token>
TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET: <use twitter access secret>
TWITTER_LISTEN_TO: <use your @tag>
TWITTER_FILTER_CONTAINING: <use keyword you want to filter in tweets>
TWITTER_PROCESS_RETWEETS: true
```

For example:

```
TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY: VKXm5av23232323
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET: fFFBwragPUMr1Qxs4xp412123456767
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN: 978904526-ULv0Tkt14qRF33CS123234567

      LOGGING: true
      LOG_LEVEL: info
      OUTPUT_TYPE: json
      SAVE_TYPE: cloudant
  **
```

It will be similar to the screenshot below:

![](doc/source/images/manifest.png)

### Configure to run locally

The `env.sample` file in the `server` folder should be copied to `.env` before the application is executed on IBM Cloud or locally. The `.env` file chould also reside on the `server` folder as it is required by the server code.

> The `.env` file is where all the parameters like credentials, log settings and other constants required by this application is kept.

#### **Configure service credentials**

The credentials for IBM Cloud services (App ID, Tone Analyzer, Natural Language Understanding, and Cloudant), can be found in the `Services` menu in IBM Cloud, by selecting the `Service Credentials` option for each service.

> NOTE: When provisioning Cloudant, for `Available authentication methods` choose `Use both legacy credentials and IAM`

![Cloudant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/watson-online-store/master/doc/source/images/cloudantChooseLegacy.png)

#### **Configure Twitter listener**

In the `.env` file, you can configure the Twitter listener, by adding the @tag you wish to analyze and to filter the tweets returning based on specific keyword and also if you want to consider the retweets in the results.

You can replace the following variables for that:

```
TWITTER_LISTEN_TO=<use your @tag>
TWITTER_FILTER_CONTAINING=<use keyword you want to filter in tweets>
TWITTER_PROCESS_RETWEETS=true
```

For example:

```
TWITTER_LISTEN_TO=GameOfThrones
TWITTER_FILTER_CONTAINING=review
TWITTER_PROCESS_RETWEETS=false
```

From the root of the project, go to `server` folder (`cd server`) and

Copy the [`env.sample`](server/env.sample) to `.env`.

```
$ cd server
$ cp env.sample .env
```

Add all the credentials that you have saved from creating the services, as explained earlier, in the `.env` file.

##### `env.sample`

```
# Copy this file to .env and replace the credentials with
# your own before starting the app.

CLOUDANT_USERNAME=<use cloudant username>

APP_ID_SERVICE_ENDPOINT=<use app id service endpoint>

# App level configuration
LOGGING=true
LOG_LEVEL=info
OUTPUT_TYPE=json
SAVE_TYPE=cloudant
```

### 8. Run the application

Either [`Run the app on IBM Cloud`](#running-the-app-on-ibm-cloud) or [`Run the app locally`](#running-the-app-locally).

#### Running the app on IBM Cloud

1. Compile the Angular client code and Express server code using the following command. This creates a `dist` folder in your project root directory and copies the compile code and necessary files to be deployed to IBM cloud.

Open Git bash, and run the following commands:

```
$ npm run build
```

2. If your git bash session is not already logged in to IBM Cloud, then login using the following commands, as explained before:

```
$ ibmcloud login
```

```
$ ibmcloud target --cf-api <CF API ENDPOINT> -o <ORG> -s <SPACE>
```

3. Push the app to IBM Cloud.

```
$ ibmcloud app push
```

4. The application should now be running on IBM Cloud and listening to Tweets. You can get the application URL by going to `Cloud Foundry Applications` section of IBM cloud dashboard. Click the name of the application you just pushed and clikc `Visit App URL` to access the application.

![](doc/source/images/ibm-cloud-dashboard.png)

![](doc/source/images/visit-app-url.png)

#### Running the app locally

Once all the credentials are in place, the application can be started with:

```
$ npm run start
```

The server runs on port `3000` and the `client` runs on port `4200`. You can access the UI by accessing the following URL in the browser:

`http://localhost:4200`

## Sample Output

You will see informations about Tweets:
